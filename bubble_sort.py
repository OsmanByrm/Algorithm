BUBBLE SORT ALGORITHM
====================
Simple explanation: Compare pairs of adjacent items and swap them if they're in wrong order.
Keep doing this until no more swaps are needed. Large items "bubble up" to the end.
It's like sorting cards by repeatedly comparing neighbors and swapping if needed.
