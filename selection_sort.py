SELECTION SORT ALGORITHM
=======================
Simple explanation: Find the smallest item in the list and put it at the beginning.
Then find the next smallest and put it in the second position. Repeat until done.
It's like organizing your bookshelf by always picking the thinnest remaining book first.
