# 10 Essential Algorithms in Python 🐍

This collection contains 10 fundamental algorithms implemented in Python with simple explanations, detailed comments, and working examples. Perfect for learning algorithms!

## 📚 Algorithms Included

### 🔍 Search Algorithms
1. **[Linear Search](linear_search.py)** - Search through each item one by one
   - Simple but slow: O(n)
   - Like looking for a book by checking each shelf

2. **[Binary Search](binary_search.py)** - Fast search in sorted lists
   - Much faster: O(log n)
   - Like guessing a number by always picking the middle

### 🔄 Sorting Algorithms
3. **[Bubble Sort](bubble_sort.py)** - Compare neighbors and swap
   - Time: O(n²)
   - Large items "bubble up" to the end

4. **[Selection Sort](selection_sort.py)** - Find smallest, put at beginning
   - Time: O(n²)
   - Like organizing books by always picking the thinnest first

5. **[Insertion Sort](insertion_sort.py)** - Insert each item in correct position
   - Time: O(n²), but fast for small/nearly sorted lists
   - Like organizing playing cards in your hand

6. **[Merge Sort](merge_sort.py)** - Divide and conquer approach
   - Time: O(n log n) - much better!
   - Split in half, sort each half, then merge

7. **[Quick Sort](quick_sort.py)** - Pick pivot, partition around it
   - Time: O(n log n) average
   - Like organizing people by height using a reference person

### 🧮 Mathematical Algorithms
8. **[Fibonacci](fibonacci.py)** - Each number = sum of previous two
   - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...
   - Appears in nature: flowers, pinecones, shells!

9. **[Factorial](factorial.py)** - Multiply number by all smaller positive numbers
   - 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
   - Used for counting arrangements

### 🎯 Problem-Solving Algorithms
10. **[Two Sum](two_sum.py)** - Find two numbers that add to target
    - Brute force: O(n²) vs Hash map: O(n)
    - Like finding two items that cost exactly $20 together

## 🚀 How to Run

Each file is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
python linear_search.py
python bubble_sort.py
python fibonacci.py
# ... and so on
```

## 📖 What You'll Learn

- **Time Complexity**: How fast algorithms run (O notation)
- **Space Complexity**: How much memory they use
- **Trade-offs**: Fast vs memory-efficient vs simple
- **When to use each algorithm**
- **Real-world applications**

## 🎓 Learning Path

**Beginners start here:**
1. Linear Search - easiest concept
2. Bubble Sort - visual and intuitive
3. Fibonacci - introduces recursion

**Then move to:**
4. Binary Search - shows power of sorting
5. Selection/Insertion Sort - more sorting techniques
6. Factorial - more recursion practice

**Advanced algorithms:**
7. Merge Sort - divide and conquer
8. Quick Sort - efficient sorting
9. Two Sum - hash maps and optimization

## 💡 Key Concepts Explained

### Time Complexity (Big O)
- **O(1)**: Instant - same time regardless of size
- **O(n)**: Linear - time grows with size
- **O(n²)**: Quadratic - time grows with size squared
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic - very efficient for large data

### Real-World Applications
- **Search**: Finding contacts, web search, database queries
- **Sorting**: Organizing data, preparing for other algorithms
- **Fibonacci**: Art, architecture, nature patterns
- **Factorial**: Probability, combinations, arrangements
- **Two Sum**: Financial calculations, inventory management

## 🔧 Code Features
